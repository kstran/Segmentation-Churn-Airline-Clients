This project is a work in the field of business analysis and focuses on the formation of business recommendations to increase the loyalty of the company's customers. The work is based on real data of a large Russian company operating in many cities of the country. The paper analyzes the data using a number of statistical tests. The project includes assessments of such business metrics as, for example, LTV, and also uses a number of methods of business analysis and classical data analysis, including machine learning techniques (logistic regression, prediction tree), cluster analysis, PCA analysis (principal component analysis) and bayesian network. Also, the project presents visualization of data and analysis results.

## Data
Customer satisfaction database for Russia, 2008-2013. It is based on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction) data with modifications. You can explore the airline datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction) to describe the variables if you are stuck with their names. Each line in the dataset describes a customer (their gender, age, hometown, number of flights, dates of first and last flight, average check, average delay of their departure and arrival, and their satisfaction). In addition, there data on their satisfaction with 14 specific services, each of which is rated on a scale from 0 (completely unsatisfied) to 5 (completely satisfied).
